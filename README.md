# cms_php

## Approach

This was a new territory for me because I never wrote a PHP app before. I decided to write this CMS system because when I was in London I started to write a blog ( haven't posted many posts but I'm working on that ), so I decided to write my personal CMS system for managing my posts. 

I saw this as a perfect opportunity to learn something new and different from what I learnt since now so I decided to try PHP, Apache, MySQL and Bootstrap.

At the beginning it was difficult to get used to this new technology and I had to set up my machine. I had to choose between using XAMP or set up every single component for the project, I opted for the second option. 
It required me more time before actually start to code but this gave me an overview on how all the components work together.

I haven't used any framework because I think that these will give me a better understanding of PHP as a whole.

I started this project by using a bootstrap template and then I deleted everything that wasn't needed and started to work form the home pages  back to the admin pages.

In this application I decided to make a difference between the type of users which can be normal users or admin user in this way the admin has a general overview of all the users that are using the application and about all the posts that are present. Also I decided that every one can make a comment to the posts but these comments need to be approved before being published and this task is performed by the user who wrote the post. 

A user can also search post by tags, by categories and by authors

I published this Web App on a server that I had. The primary use of that server is form the website that I've made for Autotrasporti Srl which is the company of my parents. The web site was also made by me while doing this project.
