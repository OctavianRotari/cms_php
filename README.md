#CMS PHP

## Description

My final assessment in the php course was to build a fully functioning CMS
(content management system).  This project was constructed of two parts, a blog
part which was accessible to all online users as a platform to access published
blog posts and an admin part, whereby registered users could upload and modify
blog posts with categories and contents.

## Aproach

I took a relatively unorthodox approach here, by not using a framework.  The
logic behind this was that frameworks are best used in scenarios whereby the
developer is well acquainted with the language, however, considering i was an
absolute amateur at this point, the use of a framework wouldn’t have been so
beneficial.  This made progress difficult at first but armed with the course’s
resources, the end goal was not so far out of reach.

## Conclusions

I personally found that PHP was a nice, clear and simple language to use, with
my Rudy background.  However, in general i prefer the functionality of Ruby, it
allows for more detailed and regular testing in the developmental stages.
Which without, medium/large projects would be sub-quality. A lesson learnt
was the difficulties that can be presented and the changes to tactics that must
be made when opting to tackle a project without a framework due to an
inexperience in the coding language. However, now a confident user of PHP,
future projects will have frameworks in their development.
